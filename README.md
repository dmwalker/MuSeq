# MuSeq

This data resposity consist of the data files, python code and R code used to analyze Mu transposition across the E. coli genome.

The python code was last run succesfully on Dec, 12 2019 on the TACC computing cluster Lonestar5 using Python 3.7.0

Coding Files:  
MAPS.py is the python code used to identify Mu transposition sites.  

Data Files:  
Insertion counts are provided in the Mu_counts file  
Sequencing depths are provided in the Sequence_Depth file  
Links to the SRA deposit of FASTQ files are in the SRA_links.txt file
